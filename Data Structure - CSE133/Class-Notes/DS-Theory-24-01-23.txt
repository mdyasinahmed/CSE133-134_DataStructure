Data Structure

    :: Introduction
        # Data Structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retreiving, and storing data.
        # It is a storage that is used to arrange the data.
        # It is a way of arranging data on computer.So that it can be accessed and opdated efficiently.
        # There are various type of DS
        # Depending on recquirement, the DS is choised

                                    Data Structure

                    Primitive DS                            Non-Primitive DS
            
    Integer     Real    Character   Boolean         Linear DS           Non-Linear DS
                /Number                              - Array                - Tree
                                                     - Linked List          - Graph
                                                     - Stack
                                                     - Queue
    *Basically 2 types -> Linear and Non-Linear

        Primitive: 
            when we work with single data
        Non-Primitive: 
            when we work with multiple data

        Linear: 
            sequence or order data

        Non-Linear:
            messy data

    ::Linear Data Structure

        Array => [ 2 3 4 ]

        Linked List => [ Head-> 2|next -> 3|next -> 4|next ->NULL ]

                            *next means - memory location

        Stack => [ 2 3 4    ]   (LIFO-> last in, First out)
                    example - which thing we put last 

        Queue => [ 2 3 4    ]   (FIFO-> First in, First out)
                    example - things we put first will pick first
