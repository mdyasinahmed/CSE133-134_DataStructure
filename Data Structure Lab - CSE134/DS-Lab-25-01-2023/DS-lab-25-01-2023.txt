# Algorithm: An algorithm os a well defined list of steps of solving a particular problem.
        Example:
            Selection sort (array, size)
                repeat (size-1) times
                    set the first unsorted element as the minimum
                        for each of the element
                            if element < currentMinimum
                                set the element as new minimum
                        swap the minimum with the first unsorted element
            End Selection sort

* The time and space it uses are two major measures of the efficiency of an algorithm.

# Complexity: The Complexity of an algorithm is the function f(n) which measures the time and/or space used by an algorithm in terms of the input size n.
            - How much time its takes
            - amount of storage its required

# Time-Space Tradeoff: The Time-Space Tradeoff is a way of solving a problem or calculation in less time by using more Storage space, or solving a problem in very little space by spending a long time.

# Data Structure Operations:
        * Traversing
        * Searching
        * Inserting
        * Deleting
  //There are two operations which are used in special situation
        * Sorting
        * Merging
